= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource. Will return 200.

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource. Will return 201 for success.

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource as an idempotent call. May also create the resource in
rare cases, e.g. if it a singleton resource. Will return 200 with Content, 204 without Content

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates. Will return 200 with Content, 204 without Content

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource. Will return 204
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
|  * The request completed successfully
* An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information.


| `401 Unauthorized`
| User is not logged in and Authorization is necessary

| `403 Forbidden`
| User is authenticated but Authorization is not given on this resource

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist, the URL describes nothing

| `405 Method not allowed`
| The requested path does not support this operation

| `409 Conflict`
| Another similar resource already exist, Creation is not possible

| `415 Unsupported Media Type`
| Only json is supported

|===

[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

=== Requests

Every authenticated request needs following header(s):

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
PRIVATE-TOKEN: $SECRET_PRIVATE_TOKEN
----

The Private Token can be obtained during authentication

=== Response

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: $NUMBER
----

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/register-fail/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to register a user with a existing username
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/register-fail/http-response.adoc[]

[[authentication]]
== Authentication - /auth

Almost every endpoint has to be authenticated.Exceptions are those endpoints under /api/v1/auth/ and /docs.

Authentication is possible by setting the PRIVATE-TOKEN in the header.This uses the same strategy like gitlab,
therefore clients can use the same header to communicate with the gitlab backend as to the MLReef backend.

To obtain this token, a login is necessary with valid credentials.

[[authentication-register]]
=== POST /auth/register

Registering creates a new MLReef user which has a new gitlab user and Person.

[[project-pipelineconfig]]
== Pipelines of Project  - /data-projects/:id/pipelines

Pipelines can be accessed in two manners: scoped to a DataProject or standalone.
For creation, a DataProject and therefore a nested call is necessary.

See link:#pipelines[Pipelines] for the introduction

=== GET .../pipelines

operation::project-pipelineconfig-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET .../pipelines/:id

operation::project-pipelineconfig-retrieve-one[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== POST .../pipelines

operation::project-pipelineconfig-create-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']

=== POST .../pipelines/create-start-instance

Use this method for doing 3 steps at once:
1. create a new PipelineConfig
2. create its first PipelineInstance
3. start that instance

Note: Do not use for restarting the same Pipeline, that wont make any sense, as a new Config will be created.

operation::project-pipelineconfig-create-start-instance-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']

=== PUT .../pipelines

operation::project-pipelineconfig-update-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']

[[experiments]]
== Experiments - /data-projects/:id/experiments

Experiments are created once and cannot be modified.
They are scoped to their parent DataProject But nevertheless, the pipelineJobInfo can be updated (creation happens automatically).

Every Subject can just retrieve own Experiments of own DataProjects.
Currently, there is no rights management which allows for more granular access rules.

=== GET .../experiments

operation::experiments-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET .../experiments/:id

operation::experiments-retrieve-one[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== POST .../experiments

operation::experiments-create-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']

=== GET .../experiments/:id/info

operation::experiments-retrieve-one-info[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET .../experiments/:id/mlreef-file

Exports the Experiment's metainformation and generate the mlreef.yml file

Output is the mlreef.yml file contents as text

operation::experiments-retrieve-one-mlreef-file[snippets='curl-request']

=== POST .../experiments/:id/start

Creates the target branch and commits the mlreef.yml.
Cannot be repeated for the same Experiment

Output is the mlreef.yml file contents as text

operation::experiments-create-mlreef-file-commit[snippets='curl-request,response-body']

[[epf-experiments]]
== EPF Experiments

This endpoint is for scripts and Bots which work under the scope of EPF.
Therefore the permissions could be limited to certain, lightweight operations.

=== PUT .../experiments/:id/epf/update

A "json blob" is needed for request body.
A json blob can be any arbitrary json data, but should be in the form of a parsable, not-nested hashmap

This will ensure the Experiment Status is RUNNING, and fail, if the Status is already higher.

operation::experiments-epf-update[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

=== PUT .../experiments/:id/epf/finish

No request body payload needed.

This endpoint will mark the Experiment as SUCCESS and update the finish time.
This will ensure the Experiment Status is SUCCESS, and fail, if the Status is already higher.

operation::experiments-epf-finish[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

[[pipelines]]
= Pipelines - Configuration & Instances - /pipelines

Pipelines can be accessed in two manners: scoped to a DataProject or standalone.
For creation, a DataProject and therefore a nested call is necessary.

All other actions, like DataInstance creation and Pipeline execution will be handled of the global endpoint

GET on the scoped endpoint delivers just PipelineConfigs of this DataProject.
GET on the global endpoint delivers every PipelineConfig that the user is allowed to see (viewable).

Therefore use /data-project/:id/pipelines for CREATE and RETRIEVE of scoped pipelines, and /pipelines/ for every other general action, like RETRIEVE, UPDATE and DELETE and the CRUD operations of PipelineInstances

Pipelines can be understood as the abstract configuration PipelineConfig and the specific runtime which resulted in a new branch (PipelineInstance)

[[pipelineconfig]]
== Pipelines - Configuration /pipelines

=== GET /pipelines

operation::pipelineconfig-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET /pipelines/:id

operation::pipelineconfig-retrieve-one[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

[[pipelineinstances]]
== Pipelines - PipelineInstances //pipelines/:pid/instances

=== GET /pipelines/:pid/instances

operation::pipelineinstance-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET /pipelines/:pid/instances/:id

operation::pipelineinstance-retrieve-one[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== POST /pipelines/:pid/instances/

Creation of PipelineInstance is special as it does not need any parameters.
Creation is actually an Instantiation of a PipelineConfig, which copies all the needed information and starts a new Pipeline.

operation::pipelineinstance-create-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']

=== PUT /pipelines/:pid/instances/:id

A PipelineInstance cannot be "updated" in terms of an entity, but certain actions can be executed:

* start
* cancel
* archive

Provide the action as a QueryParam "action", further actions will be implemented.

PipelineInstance's Status:

[source]
----
    CREATED
    PENDING
    RUNNING
    SKIPPED
    SUCCESS
    FAILED
    CANCELED
    ARCHIVED
----

operation::pipelineinstance-update-success[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

=== DELETE /pipelines/:pid/instances/:id

operation::pipelineinstance-delete-success[snippets='curl-request,http-response']

[[marketplace]]
= Marketplace

The Marketplace is a place to find interesting DataProjects and DataProcessors which can be used by the user.
Many entities are designed to be public, either as "official" MLReef content or provided by community.

But also MarketplaceEntries can be found for Projects and Processors, which are not public per se, but the user has sufficient access rights

== Marketplace-Entries  /explore/entries

MarketplaceEntries are the public facade of DataProjects and DataProcessors, and have a link to their respective entity.

* searchable_id: UUID of linked Searchable
* searchable_type: DATA_PROJECT, ALGORITHM (model in UI), OPERATION and VISUALIZATION

=== GET /explore/entries

operation::marketplace-entries-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

=== GET /explore/entries/search

* Can be used by Visitors (unauthenticated users) and regular Users
* Visitors will just find public data, Users will see accessbible data as well

==== Request

Request supports a Filter, paging info and sorting info

The minimal FilterRequest contains the SearchableType:

* DATA_PROJECT
* CODE_PROJECT (ALL Processors)
* OPERATION
* VISUALIZATION
* ALGORITHM

DATA_PROJECT will find DataProjects, CODE_PROJECT will find all CodeProjects connected with their CodeProcessors.
If you want to filter for an explicit CODE_PROJECT type, use OPERATION, VISUALIZATION or ALGORITHM.

operation::marketplace-explore-search[snippets='request-fields']

===== Paging

operation::marketplace-explore-search-params[snippets='request-parameters']

===== Minimal Request

operation::marketplace-explore-search-minimal[snippets='curl-request']

===== Request with all filters

operation::marketplace-explore-search-maximal[snippets='curl-request']

==== Result

The Result is a List of SearchableResults packed in a pageable result.

===== Fulltext search

After the search filtering will be performed and pages are built, the current page will be sorted per relevance for the fulltext search query (fts query).
Probability will be defined, and can be used for sorting in frontend code:
A higher prob is more relevant regarind the fts search.
You can use "query_and" true/false to use AND or OR operation to harden or broaden your result space "probability" : 0.7662

If no "query" is send, fulltext search relevance is not applied, and all SearchResults will have a probability of 1.0 :

 "probability" : 1.0

operation::marketplace-explore-search[snippets='response-body,response-fields']

=== GET /explore/entries/:global_slug

operation::marketplace-entries-retrieve-one[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']

== SearchableTags  /explore/tags

SearchableTags can be provided via the System (pre-populated) or be created by Users.

SearchableTags can be classified in certain types, for example for the usage of a certain Algorithm.
DataTypes are *not* SearchableTags but their own enum

=== GET /explore/tags

operation::marketplace-tags-retrieve-all[snippets='curl-request,response-body,response-fields']
