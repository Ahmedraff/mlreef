### Code Review
Code reviews are mandatory for every merge request.

### Reviewer
All MLReef engineers can, and are encouraged to, perform code review on merge requests of colleagues and community contributors. If you want to review merge requests, you can wait until someone assigns you one, but you are also more than welcome to browse the list of open merge requests and leave any feedback or questions you may have.
