# Model output
Algorithm can have several outputs such as:

1. Log files
2. Model binary file

You have to set up the *output-path* in the parameters of your code repository to save the files after the pipeline finishes. 

The output files are saved as artifacts you can download them. Go to the tab experiments, you can find your experiment in the table, click it. Then you can see the details of that particular experiments, you should see in the left menu, *Details*, *Training*,*Files*, click in *Files* and then click the button *Download*, wait for a minute and you will receive a zip file named *artifacts.zip*.
