# Algorithm

The python script that trains a model is called a Model in MLReef. This code repository has hyperparameters, input type, output type and visibility.

All these attributes can be set when you create a new model.

## How to create a new Model:

1. In the dashboard in the right side there is a dropdown list, click the button New Project and choose *New Model*.

2. Write the name, description, data types and privacy level (public, private).

3. Upload the python code using Git or manually in the site. You can clone the project, copy the code in the folder that you cloned and in the terminal:

```shell
git add --all
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin master
```
Git is going to ask you for the username and password, use the ones that you set up in MLReef.
