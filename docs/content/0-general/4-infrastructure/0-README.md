# Infrastructure

MLReef is currently built on Amazons AWS services (https://aws.amazon.com/). MLReef is hosted and operates on these services, 
but it is built that it can be self-hosted on any other infrastructure (Microsoft, Apple or Linux). 


## References and support

In this section we want to officially give credit to the various open source project that MLReef is based on or where we profited in any other way. 

### GitLab

Part of our backend is built on GitLabÂ´s [Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/). Furthermore, we have used part of their incredible user documentation for ours as well, especially for [git related topics](../0-concepts/1-new_to_git). 

A special thanks also for being so open on many other mathers, such as learning how to build a all-remote company or how to work with OKRs. As a small token of gratitude, we are developing MLReef on GitLab using premium subscription for all our team members.
