# UI components

These are components that:

+ Are prefixed with **M** to improve their discoverability.
+ Are meant to be as long reusable as they can.
+ Ideally should not be connected anywise.
+ Should not fire actions nor API requests, because those could turn out into *state update errors* and *memory lacks*.
