# Currently, the end2end tests can only be run against localhost:80.
# https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/821
# Therefore, in order to run the tests against an any server
# this script provides a reverse proxy listening to localhost:80
# and forwarding the API requests to $INSTANCE_HOST
#
# KNOWN ISSUES
#
# 1. This script creates a proxy server listening on port 80.
#    On Linux and OSX it has to be run as sudo.
# 2. After the tests are finished the proxy does not shutdown
#    This is a feature ;-)
#
#    You can run this script as "setup" and do all subsequent
#    runs skipping the `npm install` and just running `npm run end2end`
#    in your console.
