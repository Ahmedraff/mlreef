[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

=== Requests

Every authenticated request needs following header(s):

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
PRIVATE-TOKEN: $SECRET_PRIVATE_TOKEN
```

The Private Token can be obtained during authentication

=== Response

```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: $NUMBER
```

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/register-fail/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to register a user with a existing username
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/register-fail/http-response.adoc[]

[[authentication]]
== Authentication - /auth

Almost every endpoint has to be authenticated. Exceptions are those endpoints under /api/v1/auth/ and /docs.

Authentication is possible by setting the PRIVATE-TOKEN in the header. This uses the same strategy like gitlab,
therefore clients can use the same header to communicate with the gitlab backend as to the MLReef backend.

To obtain this token, a login is necessary with valid credentials.

[[authentication-register]]
=== /auth/register

Registering creates a new MLReef user which has a new gitlab user and Person.

[[authentication-login]]
=== /auth/login

Login can be executed with the username or the email.

operation::login-success[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,http-response,response-fields']
